The repository includes tools to acquire and manage data on research funding from selected funding agencies.

For now, it is foreseen to include data of those research funding agencies/programmes which make their data openly accessible  either as downloadable datasets or through dedicated API.

Please refer to the file **datasets_source.md** in the documentation folder for a list of funding agencies/programmes considered.
